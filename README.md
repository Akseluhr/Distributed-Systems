This folder consists of five assignments which were completed during a Distributed Systems course I took at KTH, Stockholm.

En each assignment folder, a short report is provided where I describe relevant concepts and the purpose of the assignment.

Rudy - Client and server communication with HTTP request
Routy - Link-state routing, algorithms for finding shortest path to destination
Loggy - Logical time

Happy reading and coding!
