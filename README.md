# ID2201---Distributed-Systems-Projects
This folder consists of five assignments which were completed during a Distributed Systems course I took at KTH, Stockholm.

En each assignment folder, a short report is provided where I describe relevant concepts and the purpose of the assignment.

Happy reading and coding!
